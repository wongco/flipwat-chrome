# flipwat - Prototype Chrome Extension

The flipwat chrome extension is a mock front end extension that uses new blank Chrome Tabs to display flash card questions for review

## Setup

1. clone repo locally
2. In chrome, go to chrome://extensions/
3. Click the checkbox for Developer Mode in the upper right hand corner.
4. Click Load unpacked
5. Browser to the locally cloned folder

Now, the default behavior will be to load this extension everytime a new tab is opened.

By default, the targeted backend is https://flipwat-wongco-api.herokuapp.com
